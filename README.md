# gambletron

Welcome to the Gambletron, a program that focuses on teaching statistics
through sabermetrics...inspired by another [gamble-tron](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Gamble-Tron_2000).

It's just a collection of helper functions to populate and access a SQLite database, then run some rudimentary statistics on various signals.

## Installation

The only installation that really needs to be done is described in the `doc/bootstrap-db.md` documentation, and its to initialize the database with Lahman's data.
